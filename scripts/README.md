# Scripts
Collection of various programs written during project development.

### Grid_Generation:
Generate Grids using random, sobol, and QLJ methods. 
For Demonstration purposes use 2D-Gaussian distribution. 

### Moments:
Compute various moments associated with the grid points distribution. 
For Demonstration use an underlying potential P(x) defined to be a Gaussian.
All moments are known analytically, and are used for error testing.
