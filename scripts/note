Codes:
2D-Gaussian
Random points, quasi random, quasi-random with rejection, Q-regular

correlation:
was a simple correlation function calculatinos, could be useful as a tutorial,
probbaly do not need to keep it in this directory should place in numerical tutorials codes

1D/2D Harmonic Oscillator:
Only have a rough draft of the code should make a full version
uniform, quasi-regular

2D-Morse:

May want to keep the code that uses original monte carlo algorithm
i.e. the single potential term and the pair-wise potnetial term

With delta
without delta
alpha as a fn of p
alpha as a fn of distance 

3D-Morse
With delta
without delta
alpha as a fn of p
alpha as a fn of distance  (make this main, currently only on github)
